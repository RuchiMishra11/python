# 🐍 Python Learning Journey  
Welcome to my Python learning repository!  
This repo documents my **daily progress** as I learn Python step-by-step — from the absolute basics to deeper programming concepts.  
Every file in this repository represents one concept that I practiced, understood, and implemented myself.

This is more than just code —  
✨ It is my **learning journal**,  
✨ My **growth tracker**,  
✨ And a space where I keep improving one day at a time.

## 📌 About This Repository  
This repository contains small, focused Python programs.  
Each file covers a specific concept, making the learning process clear, organized, and easy to revisit later.

I update this repo regularly as I continue exploring Python and solving new problems.

---

## 🚀 Learning Goals  
- Build a strong foundation in Python  
- Practice each concept through hands-on coding  
- Strengthen logic & problem-solving skills  
- Stay consistent with daily learning  
- Track progress through version control (Git & GitHub)

## 🛠 How to Run the Code  

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RuchiMishra11/python.git
cd python

## 🛠 How to Run any file:

 python filename.py
 
 for example
 python 04_if_else.py

 
🌱 What’s Coming Next
I will continue expanding this repository with:

→Functions
→Lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets
→File handling
→Error handling
→Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
→Data structures & algorithms
→Mini Python projects
→More practice problems

✨ Why This Repo Exists

Because learning programming is not about speed — it’s about consistency.
This repo helps me:
## stay motivated
## track my growth
## experiment with new ideas
## and build strong coding habits
## Every commit is one step forward.
And I’m excited to see how far this journey goes. 🚀
