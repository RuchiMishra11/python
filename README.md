 🐍 Python Learning Journey

Welcome to my Python learning repository!
This repo documents my **daily progress** as I learn Python step-by-step — from the basics to deeper programming concepts.
Every file represents one concept that I practiced, understood, and implemented.

This is more than just code —
✨ It is my **learning journal**
✨ My **growth tracker**
✨ And a space where I improve one day at a time.

## 📌 About This Repository

This repository contains small, focused Python programs.
Each file covers a specific concept, making the learning process simple, organized, and easy to revise later.

I update this repo regularly as I continue exploring Python and solving new problems.

## 🚀 Learning Goals

* Build a strong foundation in Python
* Practice each concept through hands-on coding
* Improve logic & problem-solving skills
* Stay consistent with daily learning
* Track progress through version control (Git & GitHub)

## 🌱 What’s Coming Next

I will continue expanding this repository with:

* → Functions
* → Lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets
* → File handling
* → Error handling
* → Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* → Data structures & algorithms
* → Mini Python projects
* → More practice problems

## ✨ Why This Repo Exists

Because learning programming is not about speed — it’s about **consistency**.

This repo helps me:
→ stay motivated
→ track my growth
→ experiment with new ideas
→ build strong coding habits

Every commit is a step forward.
And I’m excited to see how far this journey goes. 🚀
